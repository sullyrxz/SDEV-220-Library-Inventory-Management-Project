## Requirements:
##### ~ A GUI that interacts with at least 3 classes (Item, Book, and comic)
##### ~ Must use collections (lists, tuples, arrays, and or dictionaries)
##### ~ Must have no runtime or syntax errors and produce correct results
##### ~ Needs documentation including the proposal, class diagram, and
#####   report of results with sample output

## Plan to Fulfill Requirements:
##### ~ The GUI will have several functions in order to fulfill the requirements:
########## - Add books or comics to the "inventory"
########## - Search for items within inventory with the ability to
##########   filter out comics or books in the search
########## - Remove items from the inventory
##### ~ Will use lists within the items' attributes if it is possible to have multiple of said attribute
########## - This may require additional functionality for displaying these items to avoid errors
##### ~ dictionaries can be used to store items in the "inventory"
##### ~ We have the proposal and class diagram and thus just need reports of results (use unit testing to get these)
